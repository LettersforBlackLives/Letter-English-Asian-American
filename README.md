# About the Letter

This is the first letter in the [Letters for Black Lives](http://about.lettersforblacklives.com) project, a set of crowdsourced, multilingual, and culturally-aware resources aimed at creating a space for open and honest conversations about racial justice, police violence, and anti-Blackness in our families and communities.

Since its conception on July 7th, 2016, this open letter has been drafted collaboratively by dozens of contributors on a public Google Document—and translated by hundreds more into 20+ languages.  The original intent of this letter was to serve as a multilingual resource for Asian-Americans who wanted to talk to their immigrant parents about anti-Blackness and police violence, but the project has since expanded to include messaging for Latinx and African immigrants as well as people living in Canada and Europe.

All contributors to this project are united around one common goal: speaking empathetically, kindly, and earnestly to our elders about why Black lives matter to us. As many of us are first- and second-generation immigrants ourselves, we know first-hand that it can be difficult to find the words to talk about this complex issue, especially in the languages that resonate most with our elders. Our hope with this letter and its translations is to make it easier for people to craft their own starting points, and serve as a first step towards more difficult intergenerational conversations about race and police violence.

We are not looking to center ourselves in the conversation about anti-Blackness, but rather to serve as responsible allies—to educate, organize, and spread awareness in our own communities without further burdening Black activists, who are already doing so much. Please visit the [#BlackLivesMatter](http://blacklivesmatter.com) and [Campaign Zero](http://www.joincampaignzero.org/#vision) sites for more information on the core movement.

We wanted to write a letter — not a think piece or an explainer or a history lesson — because changing hearts and minds in our community requires time and trust, and is best shaped with dialogue. We know that this letter is far from perfect: it’s a bit homogenized, not comprehensive, and even excludes perspectives. Most of the important work of the letter is not being done in the English version, which was meant to be a basic template for translators, but in the translations themselves. Because we view translation as a cultural and not just linguistic process, many of the translations have changed portions of the letter to better address particular experiences, whether it’s the role of imperialism in their immigration or specific incidents in their community.

Even beyond that, we encourage each individual to adapt this letter to their own needs to best reach their families. Every family has a different experience, and this is merely a resource for you to use. **That’s why this letter, and its translations, are published with a [CC0 Public Domain license](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/)**–anyone can use any part of it, though we’d appreciate a linkback. 

Our hope with this letter is to make it easier for people to start difficult conversations, build empathy and understanding, and move us forward to real change.


##About Letters for Black Lives##
####An Open Letter Project on Anti-Blackness####

[Letters for Black Lives](http://lettersforblacklives.com) is a set of crowdsourced, multilingual, and culturally-aware resources aimed at creating a space for open and honest conversations about racial justice, police violence, and anti-Blackness in our families and communities. 

We began as a group of Asian Americans and Canadians writing an intergenerational letter to voice our concerns and support for the Black community. We have since grown to include other immigrant groups and communities of color. Our goal is to listen, support, and amplify the message of Black Lives Matter within our communities. 

We encourage people from all communities to adapt and build off of these resources.
